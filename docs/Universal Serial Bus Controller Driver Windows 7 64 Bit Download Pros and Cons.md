Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a standard interface that allows you to connect various peripheral devices to your computer, such as keyboards, mice, printers, scanners, external hard drives, flash drives, and more. USB devices are easy to use and plug-and-play, meaning that they are automatically recognized and configured by your computer when you plug them in.
 
However, to ensure that your USB devices work properly and communicate with your computer, you need to have the correct USB controller driver installed on your system. The USB controller driver is a software program that manages the data transfer between the USB devices and the computer. It also ensures that the USB devices are compatible with your operating system and processor architecture.
